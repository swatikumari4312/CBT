            <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>
            <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
                suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be

            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be

                to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for
                personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use
                the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in

                the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
            <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
                consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,
                each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
            <h1>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>
            <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and
                defects
                without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its
                own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers,
                expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to
                the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of
                performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no
                warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your
                requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications,
                systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be
                error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
                representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of
                the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the
                Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any
                information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content,
                or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms,
                malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
                statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
                You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
                greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
            <h1>Governing Law</h1>
            <p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of

            <p>You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United States
                government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a &quot;terrorist
                supporting&quot; country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited
                or restricted parties.</p>
            <h1>Severability and Waiver</h1>
            <h2>Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed

                under
                these Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any
                time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
            <h1>Translation Interpretation</h1>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You on our Service.
                You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.</p>
